Non-linear Independent Components

"We propose a deep learning framework for modeling complex high dimensional densities called Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE)"


What does density mean in this context?

What is the determinant of the Jacobian?
In vector calculus, the jacobian matrix of a vector-valued function in
several variables is the matrix of all its first-order partial derivatives.
When the matrix is square. A kind of first order derivative


What is a first order derivative?
Just some algebra where you make some of the variables constant
if f(x) is a real function then its derivative f'(a) at a point measures the
sensitivity of f to small changes in x around a

"One of the central questions in unsupervised learning is how to capture complex data distributions
that have unknown structure."

^ above when talking about capturing complex data distributions, I'm imagining that complex data distributions as an image

Looks like an Img rec thing

A key novelty of this paper is the design of such a transformation f that yields these two properties of
“easy determinant of the Jacobian” and “easy inverse"

So finding the two ^ easily is important to save our cpu, 
effiency so the computer can improve prediction
